### Advanced Manufacturing (M)
The Advanced Manufacturing topic aims to support emerging innovations in manufacturing with the potential to stimulate the nationâ€™s manufacturing sector by improving its efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainability. Proposed technology should be environmentally friendly, compatible with human health and planet health, and driven by technological advancements. Examples include, but are not limited to, innovative technologies for the processing of a variety of single-component and multi-component materials, biological and bio-inspired materials, flexible electronics, ceramics, polymers, metals, alloys, and novel composites using a variety of advanced manufacturing processes. Regenerative designs using a circular economy approach (a systemic approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses, society, and the environment) are encouraged.
