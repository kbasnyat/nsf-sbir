  The [Neural Analytics]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/details/?company=neural-analytics#neural-analytics) Lucid™ M1 transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System is indicated as an adjunct to the standard clinical practices for measuring and displaying cerebral blood flow velocity within the major conducting arteries and veins of the head and neck. Additionally, the Lucid™ M1 System measures the occurrence of transient emboli signals within the blood stream.

The Pharmaceutical Technologies topics covers a wide range of technology areas to advance the discovery, early-stage development and characterization, formulation, delivery, and/or manufacture of novel drugs, moieties, compounds, products, processes, platforms or services that will improve the selection, quality, or price of pharmaceutical therapies.

The Pharmaceutical Technologies topic is not aimed at supporting or conducting clinical trials, clinical efficacy or safety studies, the development of pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or work performed primarily for regulatory purposes. Limited studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed in support of feasibility, proof-of-concept studies of early-stage technologies and must follow [NSF policies on research on human subjects](https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/human.jsp). **Proposals that request support for clinical studies will be deemed non-compliant with the SBIR/STTR solicitations and may be returned without review.**
