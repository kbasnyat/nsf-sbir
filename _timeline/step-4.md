 <br/>
**{{ site.solicitation_window_1 }}<br/>
{{ site.solicitation_window_2 }}<br/>
{{ site.solicitation_window_3 }}<br/> 
{{ site.solicitation_window_4 }}** 
  
<i>An invitation to submit a full proposal is valid for one year. A small business with a pending Project Pitch must wait for a response before submitting a second Project Pitch. Any small business that has received an invitation to submit a full proposal, or which has a full proposal under review, must wait for a resolution of the full proposal before submitting a new or revised Project Pitch. A small business submitting a Project Pitch that is not invited to submit a full proposal is permitted to resubmit their Project Pitch (with revisions to address any deficiencies) in a future submission window.</i></em>
